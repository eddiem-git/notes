#THREADING
```
1. THREADS CAN BE CREATED BY USING TWO MECHANISMS : 
 *Extending the Thread class
 *Implementing the Runnable Interface
```
```
1. We create a class that extends the java.lang.Thread class
2. This class overrides the run() method available in the Thread class
3. A thread begins its life inside run() method.
4. We create an object of our new class and 
call start() method to start the execution of a thread. 

5. Start() invokes the run() method on the Thread object.
```
###Thread Class vs Runnable Interface
```
1. If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other
class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. 
But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can
still extend other base classes.

2. We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending
Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(),
interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
