```
FACADE pattern - a mask over something else
DECORATOR pattern - makes it pretty
ADAPTER pattern - Using an object to adapt one thing to another
```
```
FACADE
-provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code,
such as a class library
-(limits) rather than extends functionality of an encapsulated object
```
```
DECORATOR
-Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
-Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality
